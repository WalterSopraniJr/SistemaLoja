<h2 align="left"> Description </h2>


I start this project with some functionality goals.

In the way of building it, I found knowledge gaps to do everything I want.

This is just the beginning of something huge. Today it is only one percent of where I want to be. I still have a lot to do to achieve what I want.


This System will evolve to support real stores, helping day by day to make the job easier.

The files above are called in index.js. It processis the information and:

- `Functionality 1`: add products in the storage.
- `Functionality 2`: compare customer shopping list with the storage.
